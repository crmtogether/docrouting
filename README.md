# docrouting
Document Routing from Sage CRM

The DocRouting will add the tab in CRM Together OS 
This is where you specify the entities and the SMTP settings (except for the password, the SMTP are all pulled from CRM email configuration)

Then for each entity you can have an email template which must be named “Send ENTITY Document” (if no template found it just shows an empty email body)
